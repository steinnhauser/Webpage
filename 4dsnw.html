        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="no-margin">
            In the summer of 2019, from June 17th to June 21th, 10 students were brought
            together in Japan to partake in a summer school dedicated to an introduction
            to supercomputer simulations of satellites in the ionosphere. Three instructors
            from Norway and one from Japan were there to teach us and help us with our
            projects.

        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="no-margin">
            The purpose of the trip was to encourage students to work together with
            international scientists in the same fields. The students were also encouraged
            to venture into more challenging projects which may be worth publishing.
            The main focus of the projects was supercomputer simulations of the NORSAT-1
            satellite in space. The supercomputer used was one provided to us by Kobe
            University. The code which would be run on the supercomputer was already written
            for us by one of the Japanese instructors which happened to be in Oslo at the
            time. This code included a model of the NORSAT-1 probe and ions which obeyed
            Maxwell's equations. The number of ions, ion velocity, magnetic fields, etc.
            was something that we learned to change for the various simulation variants.
            The entire team is included in the following picture:

        <h1>Team Project</h1>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="no-margin">
            My team of five conducted several simulations which were designed to study
            the floating potential of the spacecraft. These were designed to be comparable
            to theoretical values given by the <em>PP-regime</em> as opposed to the <em>OML-regime</em>
            (justified by the fact that the Debye sphere is a lot smaller than the components
            of the spacecraft, see the
            <a class="link-item" href="https://github.com/steinnhauser/4DSNW-2019/tree/master/Kobe">
              Floating potential lecture notes
            </a>
            by W. Miloch
            for more details). This was done for four ionic elements to investigate
            the differences. Four runs were conducted on the supercomputer: Hydrogen,
            Helium, Argon and Oxygen. Due to the weight of the last two, the time step
            needed to be doubled due to the <em>Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy stability condition</em>.
            The visualization of the data produced by the supercomputer was a central focus
            of our study. For this our group used the ParaView 5.4.1 data visualization
            software. This software was ideal for visualization of parameters for the
            3-dimensional satellite model.

            Following is the floating potential for the oxygen ions. On the left is the
            floating potential as a cross sectional contour, and on the right is a line
            plot from the bottom left corner to the top right. This was done to set a
            value to the potential of the spacecraft.
            The only run which did not succeed was the Argon. This was the heaviest ion
            simulated and will be investigated further in the upcoming workshop in Oslo.

        <h1>My experience</h1>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="no-margin">
            Japan was the most incredible country to travel to with students and
            lecturers which I had seen and worked with in my first three years of
            University. The first complimentary week in Kobe was incredible; so much
            good food which the students from Kobe University introduced us to by
            inviting us out to dinner. A big grilling party was held on Friday evening
            where the students brought the most exotic fish they could find around.
            All around a great week. Afterwards, the five of us from Oslo traveled
            onward to Kyoto, where three of us stayed for two nights. I continued
            onward to Tokyo after the other students left to spend another three
            nights in an air-bnb in Shibamata. The time I spend in Tokyo was something
            I really enjoyed. Here is a picture with some of the team taken in Kyoto:
