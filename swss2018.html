        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="no-margin">
            In the summer of 2018, from June 11th to June 15th, 18 students were
            brought together to partake in a summer school dedicated to an
            introduction to space weather analysis. Three instructors invited
            their students from Norway, Japan and the USA to work together on projects.
          </p>

        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="no-margin">
            The lecturers began with an introduction to the science and data
            analyses that would be done over the next five days. Numerous satellites
            and solar events were noted (see my notes on
            <a class="link-item" href="https://github.com/steinnhauser/SWSS-Boston-2018/blob/master/Project_Variants.txt">
              Project Variants 
            </a>)
            and the teams were left to decide what events and satellites they wanted
            to study and present in a final presentation. The purpose was ultimately
            to get to know the science methods better and to establish a good work
            ethic between teams. In my team of three, we decided to research the
            width of typical solar activity by comparing the correspondence between
            two satellites: ACE and STEREO-B.

        <h1>Team Project</h1>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="no-margin">
            My team of three chose these two satellites due to their timing of
            operation. Both satellites were launched simultaneously from the earth;
            one was launched clockwise and the other was launched counter-clockwise
            along the earth's orbit around the sun. At the beginning of the data
            collection the satellites had a large degree of correlation, which was
            the focus of the study. The correlation of the two satellites dropped
            in time as expected and this was used to assert the width of the solar
            activity which was surrounding the earth at the time. One of the main
            challenges my team faced was patching up the data from the STEREO-B
            satellite, as the magnetic field measuring instruments were unresponsive
            for some time. Illustrated is a slice of the data which we successfully
            patched together using regression analysis.
            <!-- This patching was done to have a successful Fourier-transformation for
            correlation analyses. -->

            satellites were exposed to.

        <h1>My experience</h1>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="no-margin">
            Working together with students who share similar interests and skills
            was a great learning experience. Communication and teamwork were key
            elements in getting somewhere in researching the data and I felt my
            team was successfully able to do that. When presenting the project in
            front of the 15 other students and the 3 instructors we all had something
            to discuss and we went back and forth with the instructors about further
            improvements of the research.

        <h1>Afterthoughts</h1>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="no-margin">
            Getting to go to a trip to Boston was a great experience both
            educationally and socially. Gaining new contacts in Japan and in the
            US who will likely take similar career paths to mine meant a lot to me.
            Getting to know my fellow Norwegian students better in our free time
            and travels after the workshop was also time very well spent.
