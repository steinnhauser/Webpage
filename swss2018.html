      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="lone-p">
          In the summer of 2018, from June 11th to June 15th, 18 students were
          brought together to partake in a summer school dedicated to an
          introduction to space weather analysis. Three instructors invited
          their students from Norway, Japan and the USA to work together on projects.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h1>Purpose</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="lone-p">
          The lecturers began with an introduction to the science and data
          analyses that would be done over the next five days. Numerous satellites
          and solar events were noted (see the
          <a href="https://github.com/steinnhauser/SWSS-Boston-2018/blob/master/Project_Variants.txt">
            project variants notes
          </a>)
          and the teams were left to decide what events and satellites they wanted
          to study and present in a final presentation. The purpose was ultimately
          to get to know the science methods better and to establish a good work
          ethic between teams. In my team of three, we decided to research the
          width of typical solar activity by comparing the correspondence between
          two satellites: ACE and STEREO-B.
        </p>

      <h1>Team Project</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="lone-p">
          My team of three chose these two satellites due to their timing of
          operation. Both satellites were launched simultaneously from the earth;
          one was launched clockwise and the other was launched counter-clockwise
          along the earth's orbit around the sun. At the beginning of the data
          collection the satellites had a large degree of correlation, which was
          the focus of the study. The correlation of the two satellites dropped
          in time as expected and this was used to assert the width of the solar
          activity which was surrounding the earth at the time. One of the main
          challenges my team faced was patching up the data from the STEREO-B
          satellite, as the magnetic field measuring instruments were unresponsive
          for some time. Illustrated is a slice of the data which we successfully
          patched together using regression analysis.
          <!-- This patching was done to have a successful Fourier-transformation for
          correlation analyses. -->

          Follwing is the comparison between the magnetic fields which the two
          satellites were exposed to.

      <h1>My experience</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="lone-p">
          Working together with students who share similar interests and skills
          was a great learning experience. Communication and teamwork were key
          elements in getting somewhere in researching the data and I felt my
          team was successfully able to do that. When presenting the project in
          front of the 15 other students and the 3 instructors we all had something
          to discuss and we went back and forth with the instructors about further
          improvements of the research.

      <h1>Afterthoughts</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="lone-p">
          Getting to go to a trip to Boston was a great experience both
          educationally and socially. Gaining new contacts in Japan and in the
          US who will likely take similar career paths to mine meant a lot to me.
          Getting to know my fellow Norwegian students better in our free time
          and travels after the workshop was also time very well spent.
