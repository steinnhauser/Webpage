        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="no-margin">
            In the autumn of 2018, students were brought together from Canada,
            the US and two Norwegian Universities to work on a rocket project in
            the North of Norway. This project was meant to introduce students to
            rocket building and instrumentation design to effectively study the upper
            atmosphere.

        <h1>The Rocket</h1>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="no-margin">
            The rocket had several instruments to measure the conditions of the
            atmosphere as well as the position of the rocket. The students got to
            pick between three teams: Telemetry, Payload, and Sensory/Experiments.
            Three other students and I chose to go specifically into a GPS- and
            Simulation oriented post-study of the rocket. The first step was to
            set up a GPS script in MATLAB such that the data from the GPS modules
            was successfully logged. Afterwards the team soldered two GPS instruments
            on two independent circuit boards in case one failed.
            The circuit boards were then fastened by us to the payload of the rocket.
            Following are images taken by Kirtan of the payload. Kirtan was not on our
            team but was one of the payload managers from Canada.

        <h1>The Simulation Team</h1>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="no-margin">
            After the GPS modules were incorporated to the payload my team moved on
            to simulate the rocket flight. Our team of four split into teams of two
            to model the rocket in OpenRocket (3D rocket design software) using the
            dimensions of the one built. This 3D rocket model was then imported into
            RockSim (rocket simulation software) and the simulations could begin.
            Our team split in two to do these first steps as there were many factors
            in the software resulting in a lot of errors that can be made. Once
            everything was properly set up and the two teams got the simulations to
            work, the testing began. Many factors of the rockets initial conditions
            were tested until the ones which we would use were set. Finally, weather
            forecast elements such as wind direction, speed, temperature, humidity were
            implemented and a rocket flight animation was produced. This data was also
            imported to google earth for more intuitive flight path images.

        <h1>Tasks</h1>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="no-margin">
            The simulation team was set to pursue two tasks in particular. This could be
            anything we determined was worth researching with the instrument data we had
            available. The group split in two and me and Brady Pomerleau discussed
            calculating the drag coefficient of the rocket using the GPS data.
            The mathematical model we used to determine the drag coefficient was:

            $$
            F_D = \frac{1}{2} C_D \rho A v^2,
            $$
            where <em>FD</em> is the drag force, <em>CD</em> is the drag coefficient, &rho; is
            the density of the surrounding fluid (in this case atmospheric density),
            <em>A</em> is the area and <em>v</em> is the speed. Brady and I discussed in detail how
            the center of drag would change in time and how they were influenced
            by wind speed and rocket roll. The GPS data would tell us of the
            acceleration of the rocket at any given point in time, and if the mass
            of the rocket is known (by calculating how much fuel mass has been expulsed
            at the time) then the sum of the forces (at a time step <em>i</em>) can be found by:

            $$
            \vec{F}_i = m_i \vec{a}_i
            $$
            The sum of forces on the rocket were then modeled to be the combination
            of gravitational, drag, and rocket thruster forces.

            $$
            \vec{F}_i = \vec{F}_D + \vec{F}_G + \vec{F}_T
            $$
            If the output of the thruster on the rocket is known at any given
            time step <em>i</em>, then all parameters will be known except for
            the drag coefficient. This can then be calculated for every time
            step and averaged.

        <h1>Post-Launch Words</h1>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="no-margin">
            Many hours were spent trying to figure out how to calculate the drag
            coefficient as accurately as possible and a MATLAB script was designed
            to do so, though both GPS modules were faulty and did not record the
            data properly in post-launch analyses. The launch was a thrilling
            experience. On Thursday we had a misfire which delayed the launch too
            long (bad weather caused the launch to be delayed even further afterwards),
            but on T+7s on Friday we had a successful launch into the clouds.

        <h1>Workshop Summary</h1>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="no-margin">
            It was very enjoyable to get to work with students from all around the
            world which had similar interests to mine. All the students got each
            others contact information for any possible work together in the future.
            It was enjoyable also to meet the five physics students from Tromso,
            Norway, as that's where I considered studying in my first year. All a
            very fun experience with great people.
