              I've been employed by Future Ready AS since October 2020.
              The first major project involved the cleaning, processing, and visualization of a
              dataset which detailed the success-rate of over 15,000 insurance sale cold-calls. 
              Our team performed an in-depth analysis of this dataset which aimed to identify 
              the patterns and conditions which lead to the highest probability of sale.
            </p>
            <p class="content-box">
              In the next quarter the company focused time and resources into simulations 
              of sales calls. We developed a tool which utilized Microsoft Azure's Cognitive 
              Services to perform transcriptions of call-center audio files to find patterns 
              in the conversation structures. We utilized the 
              <a class="link-item" target="_blank" href="https://rasa.com/">Rasa OS</a> 
              library for python, along with a
              <a class="link-item" target="_blank" href="https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Flask RESTful API</a>
              to produce an interface for conversations which could emulate these structures,
              giving you helpful feedback along the way. I developed a demo website using 
              JavaScript, CSS and HTML to showcase the potential of this new interface for 
              interactive learning to our investors.

              In January of 2022 I was promoted to Senior Data Scientist in the company.
              Throughout the year we've worked with a team of UX/UI designers and web developers 
              to cultivate a seamless platform for interactive learning about sales techniques.
              I currently oversee further RND to improve our product, the implementation needs 
              of the web developers, as well as the expansion and training of new members 
              of the Future Ready data science team.

              In 2020 I worked for two months with researchers at SINTEF, Trondheim
              to implement a new communication protocol between intelligent
              electronic devices (IEDs) in digital substations (DSs).
              The IEC 61850 standard for substation communication involves
              Manufacturing Message Specification (MMS),
              Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE), and
              Sampled Value (SV) mappings which are available in the
              <a class="link-item" target="_blank" href="http://libiec61850.com/libiec61850/">libIEC61850</a> library for C.
              I developed a python Graphical User Interface (GUI) using the
              <a class="link-item" target="_blank" href="https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/">PyQt</a>
              library from which subprocesses in C can be spawned for the IEC 61850 mappings.
              Efficient port communication connected the mapped values in C to
              the GUI using <a class="link-item" target="_blank" href="https://zeromq.org/">ZeroMQ</a>, such that the
              MMS, GOOSE and SV messages could be processed and illustrated in the GUI.
            </p>
            <p class="content-box">
              The main goal of the application was to allow for efficient use of the
              IEC 61850 standard in a GUI which was easy to use and easy to distribute.
              The final GUI was capable of multiple IEC 61850
              connections on varying IP ports and application IDs in parallel,
              where the mapped values from each connection can be visualized and compared.
              <!-- An estimation of the SV phasor diagrams from DSs was also included. -->

              In the Spring of 2020 the Physics Department of the University of Oslo received a large donation
              of computational nodes from the Abel Supercomputer. After assisting with carrying the nodes to 
              the Physics Dpt. I got the opportunity to have the leading role in building the new cabinet of
              nodes for the Department. 
              I accepted and spent the next month researching the hardware required to house the nodes and their
              InfiniBand- and Ethernet switches.
              After researching costs of Computing Cabinets I contacted members of USIT and managed to arrange
              for the pickup of unused Cabinets which could house the nodes, resulting in no additional costs.
              When it came time to assemble the hardware, the cabinet did not fit the node chassis perfectly, but
              I worked around this in collaboration with one of the PhD students in my department. Assembling
              equipment of such high value was challenging, but the assembly was completed in 4-5 days.

            </p>
            <p class="content-box">
              After the hardware was configured, the nodes were booted up and the ROCKS HPC ISO was used to configure
              the cabinet. This took me an additional 2-3 days to complete. This was the first of two cabinets, and the
              second was relatively straight forward to build and configure after what we learned building the first.

            <p class="content-box">
              The Physics Dpt. Computational Cluster project scope was increasing, and the 
              responsibilities of my studies and next job needed prioritization. The two cabinets were moved
              to a basement room where it is meant to join multiple new cabinets to form a cluster. The 
              PhD student which joined me on the journey took over the responsibilities.
