              I've been employed by Future Ready AS since October 2020.
              The first major project involved the cleaning, processing, and visualization of 
              insurance datasets of over 15,000 cold-call insurance sales. 
              The datasets detailed the success rate of cold-calls, and our analysis 
              aimed to identify patterns and conditions which lead to the highest probability of sale.

            <p class="content-box">
              In the next quarter the company focused time and resources into the RND and 
              development of bots which could simulate sales calls. We utilized the  
              <a class="link-item" target="_blank" href="https://rasa.com/">Rasa OS</a> 
              library for python, along with a
              <a class="link-item" target="_blank" href="https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Flask RESTful API</a>
              to produce an interface for bot conversations. I developed a demo product to showcase the potential
              for chatbot conversations using HTML, CSS and JS without previous experience with the languages.

              In January of 2022 I was promoted to Senior Data Scientist in the company.
              Throughout the year we've worked to develop a seamless UX/UI chatbot interface with
              a team of designers, and a team of webpage developers are handling the implementation.
              I'm currently training up another data scientist and I oversee further API and chatbot 
              development to meet the needs of the website developers.

              In 2020 I worked for two months with researchers at SINTEF, Trondheim
              to implement a new communication protocol between intelligent
              electronic devices (IEDs) in digital substations (DSs).
              The IEC 61850 standard for substation communication involves
              Manufacturing Message Specification (MMS),
              Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE), and
              Sampled Value (SV) mappings which are available in the
              <a class="link-item" target="_blank" href="http://libiec61850.com/libiec61850/">libIEC61850</a> library for C.
              I developed a python Graphical User Interface (GUI) using the
              <a class="link-item" target="_blank" href="https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/">PyQt</a>
              library from which subprocesses in C can be spawned for the IEC 61850 mappings.
              Efficient port communication connected the mapped values in C to
              the GUI using <a class="link-item" target="_blank" href="https://zeromq.org/">ZeroMQ</a>, such that the
              MMS, GOOSE and SV messages could be processed and illustrated in the GUI.
            </p>
            <p class="content-box">
              The main goal of the application was to allow for efficient use of the
              IEC 61850 standard in a GUI which was easy to use and easy to distribute.
              The final GUI was capable of multiple IEC 61850
              connections on varying IP ports and application IDs in parallel,
              where the mapped values from each connection can be visualized and compared.
              <!-- An estimation of the SV phasor diagrams from DSs was also included. -->

              In the Spring of 2020 the Physics Department of the University of Oslo received a large donation
              of computational nodes from the Abel Supercomputer. After assisting with carrying the nodes to 
              the Physics Dpt. I got the opportunity to have the leading role in building the new cabinet of
              nodes for the Department. 
              I accepted and spent the next month researching the hardware required to house the nodes and their
              InfiniBand- and Ethernet switches.
              After researching costs of Computing Cabinets I contacted members of USIT and managed to arrange
              for the pickup of unused Cabinets which could house the nodes, resulting in no additional costs.
              When it came time to assemble the hardware, the cabinet did not fit the node chassis perfectly, but
              I worked around this in collaboration with one of the PhD students in my department. Assembling
              equipment of such high value was stressful, but we completed the job in 2-3 days. 
              <!-- <a href="">Click the following link for a compilation of images and videos I took along the way. </a>. -->
              <!-- TODO: ADD A LINK TO THE TIMELAPSE CONTENT -->
              After the hardware was configured, the nodes were booted up and the ROCKS HPC ISO was used to configure
              the cabinet. This took me an additional 2-3 days to complete.

              The Physics Dpt. Computational Cluster project scope was increasing, and the 
              responsibilities of my studies and next job needed prioritization. The two cabinets were moved
              to a basement room where it is meant to join multiple new cabinets to form a cluster. The 
              PhD student which joined me on the journey took over the responsibilities.
