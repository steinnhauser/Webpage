### About me
I completed my Bachelors degree of Physics in the summer of 2019 at the University of Oslo and will be pursuing a completed Masters degree in *MN Computational Science: Physics* by the summer of 2021. My interests include parallel and high performance computing, as well as numerical solutions to the Einstein equations. I am most experienced in Python and C++.

### Posts
This website is meant to be a quick summary of the work I have done in Physics and Computer Science. The posts summarize experiences and extensive projects within those fields which have had the biggest impacts on me as a scientist. I try to keep the website as updated as I can in tandem with my other work.Â Any posts on large projects are likely to have a corresponding repository on my [github](https://github.com/steinnhauser) which includes more extensive reports and the codes used.
