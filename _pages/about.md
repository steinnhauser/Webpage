### About me



I have just finished my bachelor degree in physics. This fall I will begin as master student in *computational Science: physics* at the University of Oslo. My main computational interests are data analysis, high performance computing and physics simulations.

I have coded mostly in C, C++ and Python.

### My interests


### This website
The main purpose of this website is to extend my CV. It will be much easier to show what I have done as posts on this website, rather than you scrolling through my Github (but please feel free to do so).

The posts are meant to be short, summarizing and readable, but do keep in mind that most of these projects reflect several weeks of work and does of course have a thoroughly written report.
