## Introduction
In the autumn of 2018, students were brought together from Canada, the US and two Norwegian Universities to work on a rocket project in the North of Norway. This project was meant to introduce students to rocket building and instrumentation design to effectively study the upper atmosphere.

## The rocket
The rocket had several instruments to measure the conditions of the atmosphere as well as the position of the rocket. The students got to pick between three teams: Telemetry, Payload, and Sensory/Experiments. Following is an image of the team of students from the University of Oslo with a model of the rocket:

Three other students and I chose to go specifically into a GPS- and Simulation oriented post-study of the rocket. The first step was to set up a GPS script in MATLAB to log the data from the instruments properly. When
