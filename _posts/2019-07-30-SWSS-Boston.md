## Introduction
In the summer of 2018, from June 11th to June 15th, 18 students were brought together to partake in a summer school dedicated to an introduction to space weather analysis. Three instructors invited their students from Norway, Japan and the USA to work together on projects.

## Purpose
The lecturers began with an introduction to the science and data analyses that would be done over the next five days. Numerous satellites and solar events were noted (see the [project variants notes](https://github.com/steinnhauser/SWSS-Boston-2018/blob/master/Project_Variants.txt)) and the teams were left to decide what events and satellites they wanted to study and present in a final presentation. The purpose was ultimately to get to know the science methods better and to establish a good work ethic between teams. In my team of three, we decided to research the width of typical solar activity by comparing the correspondence between two satellites: ACE and STEREO-B.

## Team Project
My team of three chose these two satellites due to their timing of operation. Both satellites were launched simultaneously from the earth; one was launched clockwise and the other was launched counter-clockwise along the earth's orbit around the sun. At the beginning of the data collection the satellites had a large degree of correlation, which was the focus of the study. The correlation of the two satellites dropped in time as expected and this was used to assert the width of the solar activity which was surrounding the earth at the time. One of the main challenges my team faced was patching up the data from the STEREO-B satellite, as the magnetic field measuring instruments were unresponsive for some time. Following is a slice of the data which we successfully patched together using regression analysis.

This patching was done to have a successful Fourier-transformation for correlation analyses.

## Team Results
Follwing is the comparison between the magnetic fields which the two satellites were exposed to:

## My experience
Working together with students who share similar interests and skills was a great learning experience. Communication and teamwork were key elements in getting somewhere in researching the data and I felt my team was successfully able to do that. When presenting the project in front of the 15 other students and the 3 instructors we all had something to discuss and we went back and forth with the instructors about further improvements of the research.

## Afterthoughts
Getting to go to an all-expenses-paid trip to Boston was a great experience both educationally and socially. Gaining new contacts in Japan and in the US who will likely take similar career paths to mine meant a lot to me. Getting to know my fellow Norwegian students better in our free time and travels after the workshop was also time very well spent.
