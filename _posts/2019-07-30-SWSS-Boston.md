## Introduction
In the summer of 2018, from June 11th to June 15th, 18 students were brought together to partake in a summer school dedicated to an introduction to space weather analysis. Three instructors invited their students from Norway, Japan and the USA to work together on projects dictated by the teams which were set.

## Purpose
The lecturers began with an introduction to the science and data analyses which would be done in the next five days. Numerous satellites and solar events were noted (see the [project variants notes](https://github.com/steinnhauser/SWSS-Boston-2018/blob/master/Project_Variants.txt)) and the teams were left to decide what events and satellites they wanted to study and present in a final presentation at the end of the week. The purpose was ultimately to get to know the science methods better and to establish a good work ethic between teams. In my team of three, we decided to research the width of typical solar activity by comparing the correspondence between two satellites: ACE and STEREO-B.

## Team Project
My team of three chose these two satellites due to their timing of operation. Both satellites were launched simultaneously from the earth; one was launched clockwise and the other was launched counter-clockwise along the earth's orbit around the sun. At the beginning of the data collection the satellites had a large degree of correlation, which was the focus of the study. The correlation of the two satellites dropped in time 

## Team Results
Follwing is the comparison between the magnetic fields which the two satellites were exposed to:
